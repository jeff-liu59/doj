# doj
Simple bullet hell game created in 2020 for my Software Design and Development HSC.

Doj was programmed using the game engine Godot, using GDScript, a language primarily built off of python.

The game was developed over a 6 month process, following the style of the software development cycle, with logs, gantt charts, flow diagrams, and a feedback improvement loop.

When the game is booted up, a log opens up that has several error messages. This is normal, and a result of my inexperience at the time.
